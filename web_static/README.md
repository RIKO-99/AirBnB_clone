This directory containing a project on the AirBnB Clone on the front end side step-by-step.
The first step is to design / sketch / prototype each element:
- creating simple static pages
- style guide
- fake contents
- No javascript
- No data is loaded from anything
The projects focus on manipulating HTML and CSS language as HTML is the structure of the page while CSS is the styling and the design of the page.
ALL the code should be W3C compliant and validate with W3C-Validator.
You are not allowed to use !important and id (#... in the CSS file)
You are not allowed to use tags img, embed and iframe 
Files will be compiled on UBUNTU 20.04 LTS Orchestration.
